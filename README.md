# How do I approach designing software?
The first step to designing software is to have an excellent understanding of the purpose of the software, as well as its input, process, and output.  In this case, the input is all manually inserted into the CPP file, which is processed into a 3D scene, and visually outputted onto the screen. 

# How do I approach developing programs?
When developing programs, it is helpful to work iteratively.  In this case, I created each object one at a time, oriented it to where I wanted it, then worked on the next object in the same way.  After each object was close to where I wanted it, I was able to make last minute small adjustments to complete the scene.  This iterative work method works well for almost any development project.  

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Though I do not believe that my future in Computer Science involves 3D visual compputation, this project was phenomenal practice for developing well-commented, clean code in an iterative ("Agile") method.
